description: Aesthetics of code and why I think it matters
---

For anyone who's worked with me before - you'll know I have very specific feelings about style and programming! I can be picky to the point of annoyance about how I think code should look. But why? A lot of my reasons came from gut feelings, but over time I've come to understand why I think they're important and what they mean.

## Why Aesthetics?

First of all, let's explore what "aesthetics" means

From wikipedia:

> Aesthetics is a branch of Philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty and taste, as well as the philosophy of art 

When we speak about code, the word "design" often comes up - we might talk about "software design" or "architecture", e.g. "this api is really nicely designed" or "there's a design flaw at this point in the code".

From the Interaction Design Foundation

> Aesthetics is a core design principle that defines a designâ€™s pleasing qualities. In visual terms, aesthetics includes factors such as balance, color, movement, pattern, scale, shape and visual weight

When we talk about good design (and also a lot of art!) its asethetics are a property but not the reason it exists. In other words a design isn't made just to look pretty, it guides us towards certain tasks or actions (in the same way art is often not made just to look  pretty).
