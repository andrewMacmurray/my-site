description: An unlikely pairing of Postgres, Jackson and Kotlin

I wrote a post for the [8th Light Blog](https://8thlight.com/blog/) about an alternative approach to using constructing Domain objects from relational databases using a mixture of Jackson and Kotlin (In other words - how do you turn flat database queries into deeply nested objects). I've been using it on a work project and it's been unexpectedly pleasant! Check out the [post here](https://8thlight.com/blog/andrew-macmurray/2021/03/16/sql-json-and-domain-objects.html) and you can see a [full working example of the approach here](https://github.com/andrewMacmurray/postgres-jackson-example).
