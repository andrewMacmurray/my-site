# README

My personal website, built with [elm-pages-v3](https://elm-pages.com/docs).

## Develop Locally

Install dependencies (including `lamdera` compiler):

```
npm install
```

Run the dev server:

```
npm start
```

Build for production:

```
npm run build
```

The site auto deploys to production from `main` on `vercel`.
